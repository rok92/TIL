answer>

(서론)

**Honestly, I'd say** this is a little bit tricky question for me because I don't have

a lot of stuff in my home.

**I mean**,  I don't need a lot of furniture since I live alone in a small apartment.

**Besides, I guess** I'm not that interested in buying new furniture or home appliances.

**So, there's not much to talk about, but I'll try my best!** 

(본론1) 가구 + 전자제품

**Basically,** My apartment is small studio, so it doesn't have a lot of space

It has a single-size bed, a small coffee table, a chair and a closet.

**As for the electronic appliances,** I've got decent computers, both a desktop PC and a laptop.

**In addition,** there are some kitchen appliances like a firdge, a microwave and a coffee maker in the 

kitchen area.

(본론2) 가장 많이 사용하는 것 => 랩탑!

**Of all the items I have in my place,** I use my laptop the most.

**I mean** I guess I should probably talk about my bed since I sleep in my bed every night.

But I feel like I do **all sorts of things** on my laptop on a daily basis.

For instance, I play music, watch TV news, and take online lectures with my laptop.

**On top of that,** I buy all my groceries online, using my laptop.

**So, I would say** my laptop is the most important piece of technology in my life for now! 

(마무리) 난 미니멀리즘! How about you eva?

**So anyway,** there isn't much stuff in my studio, but I personally believe that it's better to live with

only the things I need.

**Oh! just so you know, I'm trying to live a minimalist lifestyle.**

Anyway, how about you Eva?(What do you have in home?)

(도입부)

When I want to **kill time**, I make an appointment with my friends. This is because it's a great stress 

reliever.

My routine is usually fixed. When I feel bored, I ask my friends to hang out. We usually go to a nearby

restaurant and have chicken and beer while talking about our day. Our talk **usually goes on and on**

**for hours.** It's so much fun to talk to my friends.

(약속2)

Oh! and I also make appointment with a dental clinic. I go there once a year to get

a regular check-up. Going to a dental clinic is stressful but I believe that it's a must.

(마무리)

**Last but not least,** I also make appointment with my family for a movie night. 

Whenever there is a movie to watch, I ask my family to go with me.

Having family time is the highlight of my life.

When I meet my friends, I usually go to Han River Park. **There are several reasons**

**for my preference.**

beautiful photo to upload to my Instagram.

(이유2)

Well.. Oh! and Han River Park is **within waling distance from my house.**

**Q3>**

> Tell me about a particulary memorable appointment with your friends.
>
> What made this experience so u forgettable? Give me as many

> details as you can.

(언제+상황 설명)

**A few years ago**, I had a special experience that was so memorable. One day, my friend Sam

and I went to a festival held at Han River Park. While enjoying the festival at a park, I got a call from 

my friend Clara. While taking about our day on the phone. I went to a convenience store to buy a drink.

(결과)

**When I stopped by** at convenience store, I saw Clara standing there. Can you believe it? I never

thought that I would randomly see her at a festival! I went up to her and said hi.

Of course, she was really surprised. 

(느낌)

To this day, we talk about it. **It was a once-in-a-lifetime experience.**
