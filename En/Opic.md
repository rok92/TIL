**Answer>**

**Um... wow, this question is really difficult and I haven't thought about it but I will try my**

**best to answer.**  Both adults and kids really enjoy the beautiful view and fresh air at the park

but **I think there are so many diffrences between what kids and adults do at the park.**

**I mean** adults including myself are tired **every single day so we just want to chill out.**

Stuffs we do include soaking up the sunlight, having lunch by the water and of course having

chicken and beer. What kids do at the park are totally different. They are like little monsters!

**They run around, play hide and seek!** They never get tired! I sometimes want to have energy

that kids have! **Anyways, I think these are the diffrences between** what kids and adults do at the park.

**Answer>**

**I think one major issue we are facing right now is COVID-19.** We all know COVID-19 is very serious

pandemic and **social distancing** is the key to prevent COVID-19. So the **government has made some**

**regulations on** the number of people gathering **at the same time**. But since it's not easy to monitor 

people 24/7, there are so many young people gathering late at night.

It's **overcrowded** and **it's obvious that** many poeple gathering at the same time is not helping the 

situation. I really want people to keep social distancing so that COVID-19 ends **in the near future.**

My last **stay at home vacation was a couple of weeks ago**. It was **a week-long vacations.**

Right before the vacations, I was really **tied up with work** so **I desperately wanted** to **kick back and **

**relax**. Since I didn't want to do anything, productive, I first **slept in** till noon and became 

**a couch potato for a few days**. **I felt like a million dollars** while watching TV with beer and chicken.

**Then**, I met my friends to **catch up with each other's lives**. We couldn't get together for a long time

so we talked **for hours and hours**. **My friends are good listeners and know every single thing about**

**me so it was very comfortable sharing what happened.** Before the vacation, I was really **worn out** so 

I spent every second of my last vacations relaxing. To me, my last stay-at-home vacations was the best

vacations ever!

**Q11> 요즘 집에서 보내는 휴가를 좋아하는데 무슨 이유때문이며 넌 뭘 선호함? 왜?**

> These days, many people prefer to stay at home for vacations than going on a trip.
>
> What do you think the reasons are? Which one do you prefer and why?
>
> Please tell me in detail.

**Answer>**

These days, many people to **stay at home during vacations** than **going on a trip**. I believe that **there**

**are several reasons for their preference**. **First of all**, it's a busy life for everyone and people interact with 

other people 24/7 so they sometimes want to be alone and collect **their thought**. It's good for a 

**change of air** to stay at home. After resting for a few days, their worries are gone and 

**they feel refreshed.** **What's more**, the rapid advances in technology **has allowed people to do various**

**activities** they couldn't do before. For example, they can search and download movies and TV shows 

online and watch them anytime they want. Being a couch potato and **catching up on** the TV programs

they missed are good ways to **let off some steam**(스트레스 풀림).

**I personally prefer** to stay at home during my vacation because I'm **living on a tight budget** these days.

**I'm broke** so I've been **tightening my purse strings on every possible thing**. 

**I can't afford to go abroad**. But I believe what's really important is how they spend their vacations,

not where they spend it.

>
> the past to now? Are people vacationing in different ways? Compare how people in your country
>
> spent their vacations in the past and how the ways have changed over the years.

**Answer>**

**Umm.... This question is very difficult but I will try my best to answer.** I think people **used to**

spend their vacations according to their personal preperence. **Some went abroad** for traveling 

while others enjoyed a **homecation**. But **everything has totally changed** because of the

COVID-19 pandemic.

Before thte COVID-19 pandemic, many people preferred to go abroad for traveling. **It was a trend**

to many young Koreans and families **as well.** They **were able to try out defferent culture, visit** 

**tourist attractions and widen the viewpoint of the world** through traveling.

But after the covid-19 pandemic, we **can no longer travel abroad.** **In fact**, we can barely **have gatherings**

and **eat out**. So **without a choice**, people have to **stay at home for their vacations.** **I personally think**

**this is the biggest change in** how people spend their vacations **from the past to now.**

>
> in detail as much detail as possible.

**Answer>**

**Well...** the bike I have right now is very different from my old bike. **To start with**, I used to have a 10-dollar bike 

when I was young. **I got it as a birthday gift from my parents**, and **since** I was very young, it had training wheels.

It was very small, and it broke easily.

My current bike is a lot different from the old one. **Today**, I ride a mountain bike. **I had to work 5 month to pay**

**500 dollars for this bike**. It was way too expensive, but I fell in love with its design at first sight, so I had no option.

Of course, it dosen't have training wheels as **I am a grown-up** and there are many attachments **such as** light for night

riding and a water bottle holder. **Oh, and** it has strong body and **never goes wrong.** It's my all-time favorite item, and

I adore it with all my heart.

- **재활용(비교문제)**

**Q11> 과거와 현재의 재활용 차이점 있음?**

> Have you noticed any differences in the recycling system in your country?
>
> How has the process of recycling? changed from the past? Please tell me in detail. 

**Answer>**

Yes, Eva. **There have been a lot of changes in** recycling. **As far as I know**, the biggest difference is what people think of

recycling. **I mean**, **in the past,** people didn't really care about recycling! They just threw garbage away **anywhere**,

and **at any time** they **wanted to.**

**However**, people have changed. Many people **have developed an interest** in recycling and **try to live in a green way**

these day. **What's more**, the recycling syste**m was not as strict as it is now**. The rules for recycling are now much more

**complicated than in the past!**

**As far as I can remember,** people didin't have to **pay fines** for not recycling. But these days, w**e have set days for recycling**

and **specific sites to throw  recyclables away**. If you fail to recycle properly, you have to pay a fine.

**Oh, and** there are many more recycling sites now. You can easily find one on every corner of apartment complexs.

**I personally think these are the biggest changes in recycling.**

**Q12> 나라와의 관계의 변화가 있음?**

>How has the relationship between your country and neiboring countires changed?
>
>What is the reason for that change?

**Answer>**

**Umm.... this is difficult question. I haven't thought about this..** but I will try mu best to answer.

I'd like to talk about the relationship between Korea and China. There have been a lot of changes in the relationship

between the two countires.

For example, in the past, **there was not much interact between the two countires.** **Thus**, there were not many Chinse tourists in

Korea. Oh, and **as far as I know**, Korean music was not popular in China.

But **nowadays**, **Korean pop songs and singers are all the rage in China**. As a result, there is more **interaction** between two countries.

**I mean**, many Chinese people are visiting Korea and the tourism industry is getting bigger **day by day**. I personally think that this is

the biggest change between Korea and China.
