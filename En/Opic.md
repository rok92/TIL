#### Self Introduction

Hi, I'm Rok. I don't really know what to tell you about myself. 

umm.... Ok. First of all, I'm 30. I know you don't wonder how old I am.

I live alone but don't get me wrong I have family, we don't just live together.

You know I'm into play the guitar these days. Honestly, I started playing the guitar 10 years ago.

Back then, when I was in highschool, I watched some short video about Sungha Jung on Youtube who is a really famous guitar player in Korea.

It was amazing cuz I couldn't believe his finger-style performences.

I really wanted to be like him so, I've played the guitar so far as a hobby.

You know, believe or not I can performence very well now even though I have never learned. 

I want to show you if I have a chance. I think that's pretty much all I have to say about myself.

**Um... wow, this question is really difficult and I haven't thought about it but I will try my** **best to answer.**  

Both adults and kids really enjoy the beautiful view and fresh air at the park but **I think there are so many diffrences between what kids and adults do at the park.**

**I mean** adults including myself are tired **every single day so we just want to chill out.**

Stuffs we do include soaking up the sunlight, having lunch by the water and of course having chicken and beer. What kids do at the park are totally different. 

They are like little monsters! **They run around, play hide and seek!** They never get tired! 

I sometimes want to have energy that kids have! **Anyways, I think these are the diffrences between** what kids and adults do at the park.

**Answer>**

**I think one major issue we are facing right now is COVID-19.** We all know COVID-19 is very serious pandemic and **social distancing** is the key to prevent COVID-19. 

So the **government has made some** **regulations on** the number of people gathering **at the same time**. 

But since it's not easy to monitor people 24/7, there are so many young people gathering late at night.

It's **overcrowded** and **it's obvious that** many poeple gathering at the same time is not helping the situation. 

I really want people to keep social distancing so that COVID-19 ends **in the near future.**

My last **stay at home vacation was a couple of weeks ago**. It was **a week-long vacations.**

Right before the vacations, I was really **tied up with work** so **I desperately wanted** to **kick back and ** **relax**. 

Since I didn't want to do anything, productive, I first **slept in** till noon and became **a couch potato for a few days**. 

**I felt like a million dollars** while watching TV with beer and chicken.

**Then**, I met my friends to **catch up with each other's lives**. 

We couldn't get together for a long time so we talked **for hours and hours**. 

**My friends are good listeners and know every single thing about** **me so it was very comfortable sharing what happened.**

Before the vacation, I was really **worn out** so  I spent every second of my last vacations relaxing. 

To me, my last stay-at-home vacations was the best vacations ever!

> These days, many people prefer to stay at home for vacations than going on a trip.

> What do you think the reasons are? Which one do you prefer and why?
>
> Please tell me in detail.

**Answer>**

These days, many people to **stay at home during vacations** than **going on a trip**. 

I believe that **there** **are several reasons for their preference**. 

**First of all**, it's a busy life for everyone and people interact with  other people 24/7 so they sometimes want to be alone and collect **their thought**. 

It's good for a **change of air** to stay at home. After resting for a few days, their worries are gone and  **they feel refreshed.** 

**What's more**, the rapid advances in technology **has allowed people to do various** **activities** they couldn't do before. 

For example, they can search and download movies and TV shows  online and watch them anytime they want. 

Being a couch potato and **catching up on** the TV programs they missed are good ways to **let off some steam**(스트레스 풀림).

**I personally prefer** to stay at home during my vacation because I'm **living on a tight budget** these days.

**I'm broke** so I've been **tightening my purse strings on every possible thing**. 

**I can't afford to go abroad**. But I believe what's really important is how they spend their vacations,

not where they spend it.

>
> spent their vacations in the past and how the ways have changed over the years.

**Answer>**

**Umm.... This question is very difficult but I will try my best to answer.** 

I think people **used to** spend their vacations according to their personal preperence. 

**Some went abroad** for traveling  while others enjoyed a **homecation**. But **everything has totally changed** because of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Before thte COVID-19 pandemic, many people preferred to go abroad for traveling. 

**It was a trend** to many young Koreans and families **as well.** 

They **were able to try out defferent culture, visit**  **tourist attractions and widen the viewpoint of the world** through traveling.

But after the covid-19 pandemic, we **can no longer travel abroad.** 

**In fact**, we can barely **have gatherings** and **eat out**. So **without a choice**, people have to **stay at home for their vacations.** 

**I personally think** **this is the biggest change in** how people spend their vacations **from the past to now.**

**Answer>**

**Well...** the bike I have right now is very different from my old bike. 

**To start with**, I used to have a 10-dollar bike  when I was young. 

**I got it as a birthday gift from my parents**, and **since** I was very young, it had training wheels.

It was very small, and it broke easily.

My current bike is a lot different from the old one. **Today**, I ride a mountain bike. **I had to work 5 month to pay** **500 dollars for this bike**. 

It was way too expensive, but I fell in love with its design at first sight, so I had no option.

Of course, it dosen't have training wheels as **I am a grown-up** and there are many attachments **such as** light for night riding and a water bottle holder. 

**Oh, and** it has strong body and **never goes wrong.** It's my all-time favorite item, and I adore it with all my heart.

**Answer>**

Yes, Eva. **There have been a lot of changes in** recycling. **As far as I know**, the biggest difference is what people think of recycling. 

**I mean**, **in the past,** people didn't really care about recycling! They just threw garbage away **anywhere**, and **at any time** they **wanted to.**

**However**, people have changed. Many people **have developed an interest** in recycling and **try to live in a green way** these day. 

**What's more**, the recycling syste**m was not as strict as it is now**. The rules for recycling are now much more **complicated than in the past!**

**As far as I can remember,** people didin't have to **pay fines** for not recycling. But these days, w**e have set days for recycling** and **specific sites to throw  recyclables away**. 

If you fail to recycle properly, you have to pay a fine.

**Oh, and** there are many more recycling sites now. You can easily find one on every corner of apartment complexs.

**I personally think these are the biggest changes in recycling.**

**Umm.... this is difficult question. I haven't thought about this..** but I will try mu best to answer.

I'd like to talk about the relationship between Korea and China. There have been a lot of changes in the relationship between the two countires.

For example, in the past, **there was not much interact between the two countires.** **Thus**, there were not many Chinse tourists in Korea.

Oh, and **as far as I know**, Korean music was not popular in China.

But **nowadays**, **Korean pop songs and singers are all the rage in China**. As a result, there is more **interaction** between two countries.

**I mean**, many Chinese people are visiting Korea and the tourism industry is getting bigger **day by day**. I personally think that this is the biggest change between Korea and China.

**Answer>**

**Last week**, I was cooking a chicken soup when the phone rang. It was my friend from China.

**We started talking about our day** and **the conversation went on and on.** I totally forgot about the soup. About 10 min later, I smelled something burning. **I realized the soup was overcooking.**

**When I went to check on it**, I saw that **it was burnt.** So **I had to throw it away**. I learned a lesson. You should fully focus on when you cook.



**Answer> AL**

Although my number one hobby is cooking there were some unexpected experiences.

I will tell you about this one ingredient that happened last year. It was when I planned to cook for my gf's 27th birthday. I wanted to do the best for my gf, so my original plan was to make a chocloate cake.

But the thing is... it was my first time to bake it!!

I searched information online and read every single line of it to be fully prepared. This process helped me draw up specific plans.

But as soon as I started baking, I was in a panic. I set the temperature to high and missed the timing to turn off the oven. 

As a result, the cake was burnt, so I couldn't give to her...

One food fortune was that I prepared gift basket as well. I was so worn out at the end of the day.

Since then, my baking skill have improved day by day and now, making a chocolate cake is like a walk the par for me.

Hi, I am so sorry that I had many parties and couldn't control the amount of garbage I threw out.

I really didn't mean to cause any trouble and I want to get along well with you guys so I came up with some solutions.

First, I will have fewer parties. My friends used to call me a party animal and now that I think about it, I threw a party every single day! I will make sure to have a party only once a month.

Another option I can think of is I will have parties outside!

This way, I will be able to control the amount of garbage I produce and throw away less.

Which option do you prefer? Do you have another option in mind?

Once again, I really apology that you guys feel uncomfortable and if you guys don't mind, I want to buy for dinner. Shall we meet this Sat? Okay then, I will see you on Sat. Bye!

Umm... public transportation in Korea... I think public transportation in my country is super convenient.

I prefer to take a bus. This is because a bus stop is close to my house. You know, distance is super important when you use transportations. What's more, I can enjoy the view outside while I'm on the bus.

What else.... Oh, buses travel quickly because my city has bus only-lanes.

Oh, and another big change is bus only-lanes. Now, we have bus only-lanes so there is less traffic jam.

I personally think that this is the biggest changes in public transportation system.

Oh, and cellphones these days have touchable display and surprisingly, some of them are foldable.

I am enjoying amazing new functions I couldn't use before like videochatting, online banking and so on.

**Answer>**

As far as I can remember, the last time I visited the bank was a few days ago.

I mean... I usually use the internet banking system instead of visiting the bank myself.

But, I need some cash so I went the bank, filled out a withdraw slip and waited for my turn.

Because of COVID-19 pandemic, there were not many people so I didn't have to wait for a long time.

I don't usually go but whenever I go there, it's worth the time since the bank is really clean and offers great services.

**Answer>**

Umm.... Oh, yes, I once had a problem at a bank. I was on my way to meet my friends to go to a festival together. 

Then, I remembered I didn't have cash so dropped by the bank to withdraw some cash.

I inserted my debit card into the slot on the ATM and entered the PIN by pressing the keys on the keypad.

I got the cash but the card didn't come out.

I didn't know why it wasn't working properly. I was already late for my appointment so I panicked.

I asked for a help to a bank staff. The staff told me that I can go and they will send me the new card to my home.

It was an unpleasant experience.

> Tell me the popular free time locations in out country. What do people usually do there and why are the places popular?

**Answer>**

In Korea, there are many popular free time locations. Let me talk about my number one.

To start with, Han River park is a popular place for many people.

There are 12 different Han River park along the Han River  and the park provide breathtaking scevery.

Oh, and there are convenience stores that sell  beer, chicken and many other things.

Another place people love to visit is the Olympic Stadium. This place offers great concert!

It is really big and it has state-of-the-art facilities. Moreover, there are many restaurant and cafes nearby.

The last time I went there was to see BTS's concert! I really had a good time. I hope I can visit there again in the near future.

> Are there popular free time activities in  your country? If so, what are they and are the activities seasonally different?

**Answer>**

People in Korea enjoy various activities according to seasons. In spring and fall, many people go to Han River Park for jogging, enjoying the cool breeze and having chicken and beer.

In summer, it's scorching hot so people go to a nearby beach and enjoy water spots.

In winter since it is freezing cold in Korea, people don't enjoy outdoor activities. 

Many people stay at home and become couch potatoes over beers. These are the popular free time activities people do in Korea.

**Answer>**

I think people wear differently according to seasons. In Korea, there are four seasons; spring, summer, fall and winter. Spring and fall have mild and clear weather so people wear shirts and jeans.

In summer, it's scorching hot so we wear t-shirts and shorts.

It's the opposite in winter. It's freezing cold outside so people wear long underwear and jumpers as well.

It's winter right now and it's really cold. I wear multiple layers of clothes so I don't catch a cold.

> Please tell me the similarities and differences in detail

**Answer>**

Yes, I think the fashion was very different when I was young. In the past, Koreans were very conservative, so women were not allowed to wear short skirts.

But now, many girls wear shorts skirts to show their colors.

Oh, and people used to ear baggy pants and hip-hop jeans 20 years ago but not anymore.

Hip-Hop jeans are out of fashions. Now, skinny jeans are all the rage. I believe that what goes around comes around in the fashion world.
