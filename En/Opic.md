**Answer>**

**Um... wow, this question is really difficult and I haven't thought about it but I will try my**

**best to answer.**  Both adults and kids really enjoy the beautiful view and fresh air at the park

but **I think there are so many diffrences between what kids and adults do at the park.**

**I mean** adults including myself are tired **every single day so we just want to chill out.**

Stuffs we do include soaking up the sunlight, having lunch by the water and of course having

chicken and beer. What kids do at the park are totally different. They are like little monsters!

**They run around, play hide and seek!** They never get tired! I sometimes want to have energy

that kids have! **Anyways, I think these are the diffrences between** what kids and adults do at the park.

**Answer>**

**I think one major issue we are facing right now is COVID-19.** We all know COVID-19 is very serious

pandemic and **social distancing** is the key to prevent COVID-19. So the **government has made some**

**regulations on** the number of people gathering **at the same time**. But since it's not easy to monitor 

people 24/7, there are so many young people gathering late at night.

It's **overcrowded** and **it's obvious that** many poeple gathering at the same time is not helping the 

situation. I really want people to keep social distancing so that COVID-19 ends **in the near future.**

My last **stay at home vacation was a couple of weeks ago**. It was **a week-long vacations.**

Right before the vacations, I was really **tied up with work** so **I desperately wanted** to **kick back and **

**relax**. Since I didn't want to do anything, productive, I first **slept in** till noon and became 

**a couch potato for a few days**. **I felt like a million dollars** while watching TV with beer and chicken.

**Then**, I met my friends to **catch up with each other's lives**. We couldn't get together for a long time

so we talked **for hours and hours**. **My friends are good listeners and know every single thing about**

**me so it was very comfortable sharing what happened.** Before the vacation, I was really **worn out** so 

I spent every second of my last vacations relaxing. To me, my last stay-at-home vacations was the best

vacations ever!

**Q11> 요즘 집에서 보내는 휴가를 좋아하는데 무슨 이유때문이며 넌 뭘 선호함? 왜?**

> These days, many people prefer to stay at home for vacations than going on a trip.
>
> What do you think the reasons are? Which one do you prefer and why?
>
> Please tell me in detail.

**Answer>**

These days, many people to **stay at home during vacations** than **going on a trip**. I believe that **there**

**are several reasons for their preference**. **First of all**, it's a busy life for everyone and people interact with 

other people 24/7 so they sometimes want to be alone and collect **their thought**. It's good for a 

**change of air** to stay at home. After resting for a few days, their worries are gone and 

**they feel refreshed.** **What's more**, the rapid advances in technology **has allowed people to do various**

**activities** they couldn't do before. For example, they can search and download movies and TV shows 

online and watch them anytime they want. Being a couch potato and **catching up on** the TV programs

they missed are good ways to **let off some steam**(스트레스 풀림).

**I personally prefer** to stay at home during my vacation because I'm **living on a tight budget** these days.

**I'm broke** so I've been **tightening my purse strings on every possible thing**. 

**I can't afford to go abroad**. But I believe what's really important is how they spend their vacations,

not where they spend it.

**Q12> 휴가 보내는거 과거랑 현재랑 어케 바뀜? 과거에는 어케보냈고 시간지나면서 어케 변했는지 말해줘**

>
> the past to now? Are people vacationing in different ways? Compare how people in your country
>
> spent their vacations in the past and how the ways have changed over the years.

**Answer>**

**Umm.... This question is very difficult but I will try my best to answer.** I think people **used to**

spend their vacations according to their personal preperence. **Some went abroad** for traveling 

while others enjoyed a **homecation**. But **everything has totally changed** because of the

COVID-19 pandemic.

Before thte COVID-19 pandemic, many people preferred to go abroad for traveling. **It was a trend**

to many young Koreans and families **as well.** They **were able to try out defferent culture, visit** 

**tourist attractions and widen the viewpoint of the world** through traveling.

But after the covid-19 pandemic, we **can no longer travel abroad.** **In fact**, we can barely **have gatherings**

and **eat out**. So **without a choice**, people have to **stay at home for their vacations.** **I personally think**

**this is the biggest change in** how people spend their vacations **from the past to now.**
